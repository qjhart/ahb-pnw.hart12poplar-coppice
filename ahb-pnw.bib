abstract = {Short rotation coppice culture systems are characterized by a high stool and shoot density, and by rotation durations between 2 and 3 years for species showing an extremely fast growth such as poplar. With the objective to study the long-term biomass production evolution and dynamic of such systems, a high-density plantation with 17 poplar (Populus) clones belonging to six parentages was established in April 1996 and coppiced in December 1996, January 2001, and February 2004. At the end of each growing season, stool survival, shoot diameter, and the number of shoots per stool were measured. Biomass production was estimated directly by harvesting a number of shoots or indirectly via allometric power equations. Stool survival rates differed among parentages and from year to year irrespective of number of rotations; the highest rates were for P. nigra and the lowest rates were for P. deltoides × P. nigra and P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa parentages. In the second and third rotations, the P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides hybrids showed very high mortality rates. The number of shoots per stool varied among rotations and parentages, and shoot elimination was parentage specific. The number of shoots per stool increased with increasing rotation number, while they decreased from year to year within each rotation. A single general allometric equation linking shoot diameter to shoot biomass could be used to estimate biomass production for most years and most clones. Exceptions were found for the year 2001 and for clone Hazendans. Biomass production differed among parentages and among rotations. The different parentages also differed in their strategy of biomass accumulation. Although P. nigra had the highest biomass production over 11 years, the parentage ranking of biomass production shifted over rotations. The P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides hybrids showed high biomass production in the first rotation, but low in the second and third rotations. Biomass production increased from year to year within one rotation, while it decreased with rotation number. Among the parentages examined, P. nigra and P. trichocarpa were the best performing ones and the best adapted to the multiple coppice rotations.},

@article{Ceulemans1993,
abstract = {Different allometric relationships were established at the leaf, branch, stem and whole-tree levels for young poplar (Populus) trees during their first and second year of growth. Five poplar clones were grown under an intensively cultured regime at two different locations, Afsnee (near Gent, Belgium) and Orsay (near Paris, France). Leaf area was related linearly or non-linearly (power or logarithmic functions) to parameters that can be measured easily and non-destructively, such as leaf length or width, stem or branch diameter, stem or tree height, and volume index. Only small differences in the basic allometric relationships were noticed between the two sites and the five clones. A very good agreement was observed between leaf area index (LAI) values estimated from allometric relations and from indirect measurements using a plant canopy analyzer. These observations suggest that simple and general relations can be used to estimate LAI in young, high density poplar stands or leaf area at different organizational levels in trees.},

@article{Landsberg1997,
abstract = {This paper describes a stand growth model, based on physiological processes, which incorporates a number of steps and procedures that have allowed considerable simplification relative to extant process-based models. The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; PG) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation ($\phi$p.a.u.), obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy ($\phi$p.a.) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. PG is obtained from $\phi$p.a.u. and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (PN) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate PN—the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios—widely available for many species and situations—to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations (self-thinning) are derived from a procedure based on the −32 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stem diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.},

abstract = {A new stem taper function was established for individual trees of two poplar hybrid clones grown on a short-rotation coppice. The model could be easily fitted and required three parameters to be estimated. It can be used to estimate both diameter at a given height and height for a given top diameter.

Significant differences in these parameters were observed between the two clones even if no differences were observed for diameter at breast height or total height of the stem. The model could not be integrated to calculate volumes (total volume, merchantable volume), which were estimated by numerical integration.

Altogether, 26 papers and publications have been prepared under this project, discussing a large number of coppicing mechanisms and factors of many important short-rotation hardwood tree species, the main emphasis being on birch, poplar, alder and willow. Coppicing research is reviewed briefly on the basis of two inquiries. There were 20 research projects and a total of 39 researchers dealing with coppicing in the various participating countries. A survey of coppicing problems indicates a need for scientific projects in ecophysiology, anatomy and stand dynamics.},

abstract = {Establishing short-rotation tree plantations for bioenergy and fiber production on agricultural land (abandoned farmland) would provide significant environmental and economic benefits for rural communities and society as a whole. Walker hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x P. nigra) is one of the most commonly used varieties cultivated in Saskatchewan, Canada; however, there are no existing hybrid poplar growth models in the literature. The aim of this work was to parameterize and evaluate the 3PG model (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) to predict Walker tree growth in the climate and soils of Saskatchewan. We used annual data from Walker poplar trials (4- to 11-yr old stands) established at three spacing levels (2.4, 3.0, and 3.7 m) at three sites located in central Saskatchewan, Hnr, BH, and ML sites. The data were split into two sets – the modeling set from the Hnr site was used to parameterize 3PG, and the testing sets from the BH and ML sites were used to evaluate Walker growth predictions made by 3PG. The bias, sum(predicted minus observed) divided by number of observations, for tree height predictions ranged from −1.76 to 1.45 m, and bias for diameter at breast height (DBH) ranged from −2.61 to 0.66 cm. Regression R-square values of 3PG-predicted versus observed height and DBH ranged from 0.75 to 0.98. Our results indicated that, once parameterized, 3PG could predict Walker hybrid poplar growth with desirable accuracy by only utilizing commonly available soils and climate data for marginal or more productive agricultural land across Saskatchewan.},

Initially, stumps 46 cm high had smaller and significantly more sprouts than either 8 or 15 cm high stumps. However, the dominant sprouts were not affected by the stump height. After subsequent growing seasons, the dominant sprouts were the only ones to survive, and no effect of stump height was present. Severing method - shearing or chain sawing - did not affect coppicing as long as the stumps were not excessively damaged during the original harvest.},
