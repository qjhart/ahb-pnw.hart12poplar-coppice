\section*{Models}

Poplar growth modeling was performed on a large region in the Pacific
Northwest.  Figure~\ref{fig:study-area} shows the area of study.  The
modeling was performed in a grid based manner, were the parameters to
the model estimated for each grid point in the region.

\caption{ {\bf Study Area.}  Poplar Growth modeling was developed for
  a larger region of the Pacific Northwest.  The model was run on a
  standard grid, shown by the rectangle. Grid boundaries where run at
  \unit[2]{$km^2$} and \unit[8]{$km^2$}.  }
\label{fig:study-area}
\end{figure}

In order to analyze the effects of grid size, the model was run at two
seperate grid sizes, \unit[2]{$km^2$} and \unit[8]{$km^2$}.  The
\unit[2]{$km^2$} gridded model is about 16 times larger and runs about
16X slower than the \unit[8]{$km^2$} model.  

All grid points were run regardless of the land use of the underlying
region, except pixels in the ocean and Canada, were excluded.
\emph{Should we really bounda by counties on the other sides? }


\subsection*{Potential Growth Model}

The first step in the modeling of the poplar growth was to develop an
estimate of the potential yield of poplar throughout the study area.
Potential yield maps only take into consideration the climatic,
environmental and phenological aspects.  They do not include the
technical considerations of the technical feasibility of poplar as a
crop.  However, because management regimes effect poplar growth rates
over the period of the rotation different harvesting patterns are
included in the potential growth models.  The two practices considered
were 12 year cycled harvesting, and 4 four year coppicing cycles.
\emph{Should we try inter cropping?}

The potential growth model implemented the \ac{3pg} forest growth
model over the study area, by implementing the \ac{3pg} model within a
\ac{GIS}.  \ac{3pg} modeled the growth of the poplar over a 12 year
cycle, ether with or without the coppicing cycles.  

The \ac{GIS} modeling was implemented using a combination of \ac{pg}
and \ac{GRASS} applications.

Figure~\ref{fig:growth-model} shows the modeling path used in the
development of the poplar growth model. The model developed shows the
total potential of the grieed

Table~\ref{tab:3pg-grids} shows the required input grid parameters for
the \ac{3pg} model.  In addtion, the model requires a number of other
parameterizations, primarily for the modeling of the forest. Table

\subsection*{Management regimes}
\label{sec:management-reg}
In wood energy plantations, the management regime impacts the time
between harvest, the fraction of the total biomass that enters the
supply chain, and growth rates. Coppice style management generally suggests the use
of a continuous harvest machine (forage harvester) at 3-5 year
intervals over a 12-18 year rotation. Following coppice harvest the stumps are left to
re-sprout and will be harvested again after 3-5 years.  Stem biomass that
enters the feedstock supply chain under coppice management is determined
by the year of first entry which determines stump volume.  Stump
volume under coppice management is not considered to enter the supply
chain at any point in the rotation. Round wood production implies the
use of a piece-wise (harvester) or semi piece-wise harvesting
equipment (feller-buncher). If stem diameter at harvest exceeds
$\approx$ 8-10 cm, piece-wise harvesting is necessary. Following 
roundwood harvest, the field will be cleared and preparedn for
re-planting. Experimental work has suggested that there may be advantages to intercropping
coppice and roundwood production. \emph{WHY?}. Under intercropping
regime supply chain loss is determined by the combined loss from
coppiced stumps and roundwood stumps over the rotation period.

\subsubsection*{Stump volume}
\label{sec:stump-volume}

The 3PG growth model estimates partitioning of biomass between stem,
leaf, and roots within a spatial domain defined by model input
parameters. Harvesting results in the collection of a fraction
of the total accumulated stem biomass into the feedstock supply chain
for energy production. The fraction of the biomass retained depends
upon the management regime. Stump, and saw kerf acount for the
fraction of stem biomass that is not captured in the supply chain.

Stump volume was determined using total tree volume predicted by 3PG,
a stem taper function from for young poplar stands
\cite{Benbrahim2003} , and allometric relationships between total
biomass and diameter at breast height ($dbh$) \cite{Brahim2000}. The
taper equation was used to establish stem diameter at stump height,
and basal diameter, both of which which are necessary for determining
stump volume. Allometric biomass relationships in forestry are generally described as in ~(\ref{form}).
